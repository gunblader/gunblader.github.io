Blog Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?     

The readings that were assigned this week were really funny. Pair programming is honestly the way that I prefer to code, if at all possibly.

2. What's in your way?  

As I was finishing Project 1, I realized that most of my wasted time came from trying to complete the project requirements as I was coding. I think it would be faster to read all the tasks first and then plan how I'll actually do them. Some of the tasks that are in the instructions just aren't in the order I would like to do them. I'll have to ask and see if doing tasks out of order will effect our grade at all.

3. What will you do next week?  

The Project is due next week. I'll have to get it done to the spec given. And hopefully I'll be available how to get my code to pass in Sphere so that I can get in on the extra credit.
Project 2 was announced this weekend. Its called Netflix!! This should be an interesting project.

*Make my blog site look the way I want it to.  

Tips:
Read the project instructions all the way through before you begin.
