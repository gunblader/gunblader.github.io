Blog Questions:

1. What did you do this past week?     

This week has been pretty chill as far as content goes... We are just learning more about Python's syntax and subtleties. Python is definitely different from Java. Python seems a lot more lite-weight in the amount of lines of code needed to complete similar tasks in Java. I've gotten most of Project 1 done but have been moving slow because there have been some issues with Sphere.
We learned about the try/except segments for Python. I can see myself using these a lot in my code.

2. What's in your way?  

I still haven't gotten my hands on a copy of the Xtreme Programming Installed book. I ended up ordering it online so I can do the readings.

3. What will you do next week?  

The Project is due next week. I'll have to get it done to the spec given. And hopefully I'll be available how to get my code to pass in Sphere so that I can get in on the extra credit.

*Make my blog site look the way I want it to.  

Tips:
When working on your project, you should set aside at least 3 hours per "session". I found that if I ever want to put up a good chunk of the tasks, for the project, then I need to be in front of the computer for a good amount of time. Plus, when you're on a role you don't want to have to stop the flow without getting it all out.
